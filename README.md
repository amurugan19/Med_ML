# Machine Learning in Medicine
## Primer for Emory Discovery Students

---

## Overview
Discovery provides an exciting time to learn some high-impact scientific principles and tools that will help you for the rest of your career.

In this project we'll run through the basics of machine learning, how ML differs from the standard EBM approach, and provide a set of ready-to-use tools that you can apply to your Discovery project on the side.

The intended audience of this primer is **everyone**. Seriously.
If you have a quantitative background then things might be a bit easier, but ultimately this is meant to be a resource for all medical students.
And even beyond medical students.
So if there are any points you think need clarification or if you have any feedback - send an email to virati+MedML@gmail.com

## Technical Requirements
If you're interested in just reading along, like a textbook, then you don't need anything special.

But half the fun of ML is getting your hands dirty with data (real or simulated).
You'll need Python and Jupyter (notebooks) to be able to make maximal use of the resources here.
