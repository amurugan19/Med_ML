    "# Machine Learning for Medicine: Workshop\n",
    "## A brief introduction for Emory Discovery Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table of Contents\n",
    "* Overview\n",
    "* What is machine learning?\n",
    "* Hands-on learning\n",
    "    * [Data comes in distributions](ML_Med_distributions.ipynb)\n",
    "    * EBM statistics\n",
    "    * Machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "What exactly *is* machine learning? Why is everyone raving about it? What does it have to do with evidence-based medicine (EBM)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly: how can I use ML myself to empower my dreams of becoming an academic clinician?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover these questions in a series of two workshops. Both workshops will follow the general structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do we study the human body?\n",
    "    * Evidence-based medicine approaches\n",
    "    * Machine learning approaches\n",
    "* What tools can I use to implement ML in my discovery project?\n",
    "    * Hands-on basics of programming (bring your laptop!)\n",
    "    * Resources to learn on your own\n",
    "    \n",
    "The first workshop will focus on doing basic EBM in Python, with a brief preview of ML. The second will focus on doing basic machine learning analyses in Python, with a comparison to EBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is machine learning?\n",
    "The standard way to do science is to carefully design an experiment, fix as many variables as possible, collect a large sample size, and then figure out if one thing is related to another thing. When you're dealing with a complex system like the human body, this approach is incredibly slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is more about learning the relationships in our body directly by using the data + a set of hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Essentially, machine learning is the way we can study multiple interactions in the body together, instead of in isolation**. This is a powerful new tool that we should all be aware of and familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hands-on learning\n",
    "The unique thing about machine learning is its *open-source* nature. The tools used to analyse data are often freely available. Free as in money and free as in freedom: most people provide you the *code* they used to analyse their data so you can analyse your own data using the exact same methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that with a simple introduction and a set of resources, you can be well on your way to a life-time of ML learning. That's the goal of this workshop."
